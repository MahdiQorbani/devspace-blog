Hello guys, this is a practice NextJS and TailwindCSS project

I develpoed this to add it to my resume

This is a developers blog
The idea of the project comes from [Brad Traversy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-dev-to-deployment/)

I also hosted this to vercel and you can see it from this link below:
[https://devspace-blog-pearl-ten.vercel.app/](https://devspace-blog-pearl-ten.vercel.app/)

or you can clone it and run it in your own machine:

First, you should install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

And finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.
